# Ames Housing Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Ames Housing Dataset --- a dataset widely used in statistics and machine learning --- implemented in **R**.

### Contents
- A compilation of home search criteria and recommendations from real estate agents  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
- Missing data handling
- New feature creation, variable transformations
- Linear regression
- AIC/BIC evaluation, predictor selection
- Evaluation on the test set, model tuning
- Predictions on the validation set  

The rendered HTML report is called `ames_data_analysis.html` and is located at the top level of the repository.  
You can open it directly in a web browser to view the results.

### Project Files

The project files are available in the `src/` directory and include:
